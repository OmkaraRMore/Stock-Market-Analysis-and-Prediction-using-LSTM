# Stock-Market-Analysis-and-Prediction-using-LSTM
We explore stock market data for Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft using yfinance to fetch prices and Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualization. The analysis covers historical performance, risk assessment, and insights into trends. Finally, we build a predictive model for future stock prices using an LSTM neural network.
