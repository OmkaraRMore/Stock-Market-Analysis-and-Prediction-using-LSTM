üìà Stock Market Analysis & Prediction using LSTM

Overview

This project explores and analyzes stock market data for major technology companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Using yfinance, we fetch historical stock data, visualize patterns with Seaborn and Matplotlib, analyze risks, and build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict future stock prices.

Features

üìä Data Collection: Download historical stock data using yfinance.

üîç Exploratory Analysis:

Price changes over time

Daily returns and moving averages

Correlations across stocks

Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis

ü§ñ Prediction:

Apply LSTM neural networks for stock price forecasting.

Evaluate model performance with real data.

Questions Answered

What was the change in price of the stock over time?

What was the daily return of the stock on average?

What was the moving average of the various stocks?

What was the correlation between different stocks?

How much value is at risk by investing in a particular stock?

How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?

Tech Stack

Python

Libraries: yfinance, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow/keras

Notebook: Jupyter

Getting Started
Installation
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-analysis-prediction.git
cd stock-market-analysis-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the notebook
jupyter notebook stock-market-analysis-prediction-using-lstm.ipynb

Results & Insights

Risk and return profiles differ significantly across the chosen tech stocks.

Strong correlations exist between some companies.

LSTM provides promising predictive performance but is sensitive to hyperparameter tuning and historical data length.

Future Improvements

Enhance LSTM with more layers and attention mechanisms.

Compare with other models like GRU, Prophet, and ARIMA.

Deploy as an interactive web dashboard (e.g., Streamlit/Flask).
